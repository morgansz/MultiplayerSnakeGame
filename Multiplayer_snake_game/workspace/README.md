Based on the requirements and assumptions, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the Snake game:

1. Model:
   - Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for updating the snake's position, checking for collisions, and growing the snake when it eats food.
   - Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating random positions for the food.
   - Game: Represents the game state. Responsible for managing the snake, food, and game logic.

2. View:
   - Renderer: Responsible for rendering the game on the canvas.

3. Controller:
   - KeyboardController: Responsible for handling keyboard input and updating the snake's direction.

4. Server:
   - WebSocketServer: Responsible for handling WebSocket connections and broadcasting game state updates to all connected clients.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their contents.

1. `snake.py` (Model)
